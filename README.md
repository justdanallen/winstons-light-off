# Description
A little project so I can turn a night lite off in my son's room. It is connected to an old Wemo.

I'm using Firebase to act like a socket to control the Wemo. This code is meant to run on an RPi.


# TODO:
1. Test how discovery works when wemo isn't found
2. Add logging to firebase for remote management
3. Add firebase function for 
4. Look at adding npm package 'ping'
